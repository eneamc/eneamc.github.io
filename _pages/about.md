# I am looking for Research Internships!

If you are looking for a highly productive and motivated individual, consider me:

1. I do not give up when Math gets hard;
2. I see things differently than other people.

**You do not want to miss out on my unorthodox creativity!**

## Presentation
I am a PhD student in Stochastic Optimization for Deep Learning under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Aurelien Lucchi](https://omls.dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/aurelien-lucchi/) at University of Basel, Switzerland.
My main interests are Stochastic Optimization, Implicit Bias, and Deep Learning Theory. In good days, I also appreciate Mathematical Finance and Reservoir Computing.
Currently, I am interning at Flexion Robotics where I developed a VLM/VLA-based agentic framework for robots to perform complex tasks in the real world.
There I also contributed in speeding up (50% faster) and improving the performance of their training pipeline for the rough-terrain locomotion policy.

Lately, I have been playing around with:

1. Stochastic Optimizers for Deep Reinforcement Learning, including a promising modification to how AdamW is applied to the GRPO objective;
2. New DP optimizers specifically tailored for LLMs where high levels of privacy is desired;
3. Reasoning of LLMs: Chain-of-Thought Compression.
