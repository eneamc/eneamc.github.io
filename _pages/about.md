# I am looking for Research Internships for Summer 2024

If you are looking for a highly productive and motivated individual, consider me:

1. I do not give up when Math gets hard;
2. I see things differently than other people.

**You do not want to miss out on my unorthodox creativity!**

## Presentation
I am a PhD student in Stochastic Optimization for Deep Learning under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Aurelien Lucchi](https://omls.dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/aurelien-lucchi/) at University of Basel, Switzerland.
My main interests are Stochastic Optimization, Implicit Bias, and Deep Learning Theory. In good days, I also appreciate Mathematical Finance and Reservoir Computing. 

I am a great MMA fan and I love watching WWE ;)
